### 20th Ennamene

##### All Aboard the Beautiful Bess
* After another night of drinking hard spirits in the Merry Stoat, we awoke early to travel to Baramew aboard the Beautiful Bess. We headed up to the castle and collected the pumpkin from Lord Goryon's greenhouse. While dragging it down to the harbour on a wooden pallet trolley we sent Parx to collect Sihtric. At the docks, I easily loaded the pumpkin onto the houseboat with my considerable strength.
* During the journey, Parx and I decided to stand guard over the pumpkin in case of assault from bandit pirates unknown. At some point in the journey, the boat suddenly stopped and I was thrown forwards in the pumpkin (I hope Lord Goryon never reads this...) - thankfully my immense bulk did no harm to the pumpkin.
