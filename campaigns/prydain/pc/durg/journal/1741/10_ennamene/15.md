### 15th Ennamene
#### Tylwyth Deeps Forest
##### The Campfire in the Woods
* As I was travelling at dusk down a road through the forest I came upon a half-orc setting up a campfire under a large tree. We decided to camp together for the night - in order to take watches amongst the howling trees. A few minutes later, a half-elf cleric came down the road and we invited him to share our fire.
* As we were talking, we were suddenly surprised when a halfling fell from the branches above us. He almost fell straight into the fire! He joined us for the night to take a watch.
* Their names are Parx (half-orc rogue), Ephraim (half-elf cleric), and Askrigg (halfling wizard).
* Shortly after we started to take our rest for the night, we were beset upon by a couple of ravenous wolves. One of them nearly ripped out my throat with one vicious bite! We managed to kill them though, obviously. Got one of the bastards myself with a glorious smash with my warhammer to its snarling maw! It was beautiful - I love hammers! I cut off a wolf's paw to take as a trophy.
* After this invigorating interruption we are about to go back to sleep having agreed to travel south on the road together tomorrow for safety. No further incidents.
