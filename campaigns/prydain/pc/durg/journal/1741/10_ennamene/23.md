### 23rd Ennamene
#### Northward in pursuit: Baramew to the Ystrad River
##### The Forced March
* Charging north in pursuit of the goblin scum, we decided to push hard in order to try and close the gap between us and the goblins. After an hour of a forced marching, some of the group were pretty tired and so we have decided to rest for the night.
