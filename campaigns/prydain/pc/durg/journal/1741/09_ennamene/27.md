## 27th Ennamene 1741
### Southward on the road: River Ystrad to Baramew
#### Escorts Extraordinaire
* As we travelled back to Baramew we didn't really talk to the women much - they seemed very interested in Tuilleth (their heroic rescuer!) and we didn't want to cramp his style by accidentally mentioning that he fell down a pit and almost died...

### Baramew
#### Resting and Recuperating
* Back in Baramew, I sold a shield and longsword that I had picked up from the battle in the cave to Langrian, the blacksmith of Baramew. He and his wife seemed to be dwarves but were wearing hoods to hide their faces. I also purchased a replacement 50ft hemp rope.
* We have decided to wait in Baramew for Willow to arrive with the remaining women and girls. We are not sure what happened to Prince Gwydion, the other guards, and the boys - hopefully they'll get back here safe and soon as well.
