## 24th Ennamene 1741
### Northward in pursuit: River Ystrad and Beyond
#### The Barge in the Reeds
* Upon reaching the River Ystrad we found that the tracks seemed to reach the water's edge and disappear. A few minutes of canny investigation by Askrigg - I won't forget the sight of a 2" halfling frolicking about in a foot of mud - found us a rope and upon pulling this rope a barge emerged from the reeds on the other side of the river.
* After using the barge to cross, we continued to follow the tracks until they split - half the party of monsters and captives seems to have gone one way and the other half another way. To maximise the odds of successful recovery of as many captives as possible, we decided to split the rescue party. Gwydion headed eastward with nine of the guards and we took the westward track with the 10th guard - Tuilleth! - to aid us with navigation and survival.
* We have reached a wood and have decided to take our rest for the evening just out-of-sight inside the tree line. Ephraim and I lent Tuilleth a shortbow and 10 arrows respectively - with the instruction that he should try to stay back in fights.
