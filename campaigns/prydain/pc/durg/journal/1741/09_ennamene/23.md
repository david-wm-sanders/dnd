## 23rd Ennamene 1741
### Northward in pursuit: Baramew to the Ystrad River
#### The Forced March
*  Askrigg and I noticed today that our beards have gotten more lustrous and curly - it must have been the Dwarf Star Stout we drank!
* Charging north in pursuit of the goblin scum, we decided to push hard in order to try and close the gap between us and the goblins. After an hour of a forced marching, some of the group were pretty tired and so we have decided to rest for the night.
