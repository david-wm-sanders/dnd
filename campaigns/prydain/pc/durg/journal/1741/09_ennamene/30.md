### Baramew
#### Celebrations and a Ceremony
* Willow made it back to Baramew this morning in the Beautiful Bess. As well as the women and girls, we were delighted to discover Prince Gwydion, the guards, and the boys with them as well. Willow told us that he had picked them by Ystrad Ford on his way past.
* Upon their arrival, we were summoned to the Shrine of Sucellus for a celebration and reward ceremony. There we met Godo (Colmund's replacement) and were each awarded with a golden sheep pendant and an ornate silver drinking horn for the safe return of the women and children of Baramew. After the ceremony, Ephraim mingled with the crowd and opportunistically rattled his alms box - cheeky half-elf!
* Parx went to "catch up" with Pebble and return her purple-jewelled silver earing (which we found during the journey northward in pursuit). She told him that, during her time in the cells, she overhead the goblins and hobgoblins complaining about "that bitch" using a knife to control the bugbears in order to force them to take the women and children of Baramew as captives. She also overhead them saying that the boys had been split off from the women and girls to sell as slaves. The women and girls, however, were to be used for "another purpose".
