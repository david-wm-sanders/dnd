### Eastward on the road: Baramew to Crug Hyfgha
* We left Baramew today to begin the journey back to Crug Hyfgha, in order to collect our 50gp reward for safe delivery of the pumpkin. We decided to travel back on the north side of the River Damara.
* On the journey, we noticed that the crops have now been harvested. We also found some more dead sheep but were unsure what killed them. Besides being dead, they just looked thin.
* We asked a farmer if we could stay the night in his barn. He kindly took us into his home and also gave us some food.
