### Above Haern Fell
#### Back to Haern Fell
* Waking early today, I felt as if all this fighting and questing is improving my abilities - better keep it up! I may yet be strong enough to return home one day and face the darkness there.
* We travelled back to Haern Fell, collected Parx, and travelled down into the mines again with Toadstool and Bracken in order to speak with Toadstool.
* Toadstool thanked us for our help with a days worth of rations each in the form of mushrooms. He also told us that we are welcomed to pass through his domain in order to access the deep underdark that stretches under the land.
* Back on the surface, Manganese gave us a stone tablet detailing his thanks for our help on it and also, upon asking, chiselled a tablet for us to take to Feldspar in order to receive our reward. N.B. Make sure to get written contracts for dealings with dwarves afore work begins in the future.
* Feldspar told us he will work on an exquisite warhammer and send it down with Chert to Sihtric when it is complete. He also gave us a strange bag of gold. Further inspection, by Askrigg, of this bag revealed it to be a Bag of Holding!
* We left Haern Fell and are now spending another night at the stable on our way back to Crug Hyfgha.
