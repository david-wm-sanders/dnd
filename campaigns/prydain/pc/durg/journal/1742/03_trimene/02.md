## 2nd Trimene 1742
### Southward on the road: Crug Hyfgha to Haern Fell
* We collected our masks from Rachel and set off from Crug Hyfgha with Chert and Nickel - they even offered us a ride in the back of their cart!
* After a long day discussing the gods - Nord gods (such as Odin, Thor!, and Freya), Prytheni gods (Borus, Damara, and Sucellus), and their respective worshippers across Albion (Dannics worship Nord gods as well as the dwarves) - we have decided to make camp for the night before continuing the rest of the way to Haern Fell tomorrow.
