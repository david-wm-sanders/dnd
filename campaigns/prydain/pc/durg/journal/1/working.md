### 16th(?) Ennamene
#### Tylwyth Deeps Forest
* As I was travelling at dusk down a road through the forest I came upon a half-orc setting up a campfire under a large tree. We decided to camp together for the night - in order to take watches amongst the howling trees. A few minutes later, a half-elf cleric came down the road and we invited him to share our fire.
* As we were talking, we were suddenly surprised when a halfling fell from the branches above us. He almost fell straight into the fire! He joined us for the night to take a watch.
* Their names are Parx (half-orc rogue), Ephraim (half-elf cleric), and Askrigg (halfling wizard).
* Shortly after we started to take our rest for the night, we were beset upon by a couple of ravenous wolves. One of them nearly ripped out my throat with one vicious bite! We managed to kill them though, obviously. Got one of the bastards myself with a glorious smash with my warhammer to its snarling maw! It was beautiful - I love hammers!
* After this invigorating interruption we went back to sleep without further incident, agreeing to travel south on the road together tomorrow for safety.

### 17th(?) Ennamene
#### Southward on the road: Tylwyth Deeps to Ystrad Ford
* We came across a fallen tree blocking the road with a cart pinned against. A human man was cowering next to it with his horse as goblins began to approach him.
* We rushed to his assistance immediately and managed to defeat the goblins and the allies that came to their aid. There was a hilarious moment when Parx called one of them a coward as it fled for its pathetic life, only to return shortly after with a hobgoblin that was very angry to be called a coward. He looked a bit scary until he tripped down one of the steep slopes to the side of the road and I flattened his ugly face with Durg's Hammer!
* After the battle we introduced ourselves to the owner of the cart and discovered his name to be Haistan, a slender blonde man from the Vale of Sefon who is carrying wheat and potatoes to Crug Hyfgha at the request of his cousin Sihtric (the blacksmith of Crug Hyfgha). He introduced his horse as Clover - not that I really care about such a trifle as the name of a horse.
* We agreed to escort Haistan to Crug Hyfgha (or at least Ystrad Ford) in exchange for a fee. Seemed like the decent thing to do after his useless guard (Wolfstan) fled from the goblins like a craven dog. Hardly wolf-like if you ask me! I did pick up his crossbow though and Haistan let me have the bolts that Wolfstan had left in the cart.
* Before we cleared the tree from the road and continued onwards I examined the wolves that had attacked with the goblins and discovered them to be branded with goblin tribal markings.

* We encountered a strange bear as we continued our trek towards Ystrad Ford - it quietly watched us pass as it lay on the top of a ridge above the road. It didn't seem perturbed by our presence or interested in us as a source I food which I thought was odd. Very unlike the bears I encountered in the mountains around Bom Thorum.

* Parx's orcish olfactory system led us to a huge bear shit in the woods. We thought it best to not disturb it.
