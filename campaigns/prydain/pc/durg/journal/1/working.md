#### Tylwyth Deeps Forest
##### The Campfire in the Woods
* As I was travelling at dusk down a road through the forest I came upon a half-orc setting up a campfire under a large tree. We decided to camp together for the night - in order to take watches amongst the howling trees. A few minutes later, a half-elf cleric came down the road and we invited him to share our fire.
* As we were talking, we were suddenly surprised when a halfling fell from the branches above us. He almost fell straight into the fire! He joined us for the night to take a watch.
* Their names are Parx (half-orc rogue), Ephraim (half-elf cleric), and Askrigg (halfling wizard).
* Shortly after we started to take our rest for the night, we were beset upon by a couple of ravenous wolves. One of them nearly ripped out my throat with one vicious bite! We managed to kill them though, obviously. Got one of the bastards myself with a glorious smash with my warhammer to its snarling maw! It was beautiful - I love hammers! I cut off a wolf's paw to take as a trophy.
* After this invigorating interruption we are about to go back to sleep having agreed to travel south on the road together tomorrow for safety. No further incidents.

##### The Fallen Tree
* We came across a fallen tree blocking the road with a cart pinned against. A human man was cowering next to it with his horse as goblins began to approach him.
* We rushed to his assistance immediately and managed to defeat the goblins and the allies that came to their aid. There was a hilarious moment when Parx called one of them a coward as it fled for its pathetic life, only to return shortly after with a hobgoblin that was very angry to be called a coward. He looked a bit scary until he tripped down one of the steep slopes to the side of the road and I flattened his ugly face with Durg's Hammer! I also shoved my wolf's paw down another wolf's throat in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent it from biting me.
* After the battle we introduced ourselves to the owner of the cart and discovered his name to be Haistan, a slender blonde man from the Vale of Sefon who is carrying wheat and potatoes to Crug Hyfgha at the request of his cousin Sihtric (the blacksmith of Crug Hyfgha). He introduced his horse as Clover - not that I really care about such a trifle as the name of a horse.
* We agreed to escort Haistan to Crug Hyfgha (or at least Ystrad Ford) in exchange for a fee. Seemed like the decent thing to do after his useless guard (Wolfstan) fled from the goblins like a craven dog. Hardly wolf-like if you ask me! I did pick up his crossbow though and Haistan let me have the bolts that Wolfstan had left in the cart.
* Before we cleared the tree from the road and continued onwards I examined the wolves that had attacked with the goblins and discovered them to be branded with goblin tribal markings.

##### The Curious Bear
* We encountered a strange bear as we continued our trek towards Ystrad Ford - it quietly watched us pass as it lay on the top of a ridge above the road. It didn't seem perturbed by our presence or interested in us as a source I food which I thought was odd. Very unlike the bears I encountered in the mountains around Bom Thorum.
* Parx's orcish olfactory system led us to a huge bear shit in the woods. We thought it best to not disturb it.
* Having put a fair amount of distance between us and the location of the felled tree we are about to rest for the night and recover our strength.

##### The Pissed Pixies
* Today we came across a small river that Sihtric's letter to Haistan hadn't mentioned! Surely the rain alone could not have created such a vast girth of unmapped water. This shrewd intellectual instinct was quickly validated when we tied a rope around [Parx?] and they ventured forward only to instantly fall asleep as they touched the accursed flow! We pulled them out fine - no harm done thanks to a trusty hemp rope.
* We then set about trying to figure out how to cross safely - I proposed chopping down a tree until I was reminded of Haistan's massive cart! Ephraim and Askrigg detected (funny magic stuff) some entities on the other side of the river and called out to them. Their responses were not in the slightest bit helpful but we did eventually figure out that crossing the river with our eyes closed was the solution. We blindfolded Clover just to be on the safe side and led her across with the cart.
* So furious was I with the pixie tricksters when we reached the other bank that I smacked a nearby tree in frustration. I didn't expect escorting a cart to be such an intellectual demanding endeavour! I don't remember much for an hour or so after that except a strange hunger for voles and shrews. The others tell me that those damnable pixies turned me into a weasel for hitting that tree! BAH-MAGICK!

##### The Pungent Pool
* Shortly after returning to my pure dwarf form (albeit in Ephraim's backpack - damn that was a pain to get out of!) we came across a stagnant pool of water against one of the rock cliffs that flanked either side of the road. A withered tree erupting from the centre of where the putrescent pool met the base of the cliff. Some, at first glance, unremarkable bushes stood around the waterfront.
* A new found wariness of water already welling up within us we tied a rope around Ephraim and sent him forth to collect some of the pond-water in his mess tin for further examination. As soon as he touched the waters the bushes came to life and attacked him (note to self: be wary of bushes as well as water).
* Ephraim knocked unconscious in the first blow by the master-bush (technically a vine blight) we spritely sprang into action to come to his aid. I dropped the rope, dashed forward, and threw one of my handaxes straight into the belly of the master-bush. The rest of the battle is a blur but thankfully Ephraim returned to consciousness by himself (thank Borus for that as I don't know shit about medicine or healing)!
* Askrigg investigated the pond before we left and found a fair bit of gold and a pretty gem on a skeleton lying on the bottom at the base of the tree. I asked him to pass me the skeleton's skull to add to my collection as a replacement for the wolf's paw.
