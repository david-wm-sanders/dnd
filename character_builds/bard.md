## Background(s)
### Charlatan
#### Skills
* Deception
* Sleight of Hand

#### Tool Proficiencies
* Disguise kit
* Forgery kit

#### Equipment
* A set of fine clothes
* A disguise kit
* Tools of the con of your choice (e.g. weighted dice, marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke)
* Belt pouch containing 15gp

#### Feature: False Identity
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allows you to assume that persona.

Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

#### Characteristics
*[The option(s) I am erring towards]*
##### Favourite Scam
I put on new identities like clothes.
##### Personality Trait
* Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want. (Persuasion)
* I lie about almost everything, even when there is no good reason to. (Deception)

##### Ideal
Independence - I am a free spirit, no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)
##### Bond
I owe everything to my mentor - a horrible person who's probably rotting in a jail somewhere.
##### Flaw
I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.

### Courtier
#### Skills
* Insight
* Persuasion

#### Languages
*[Any two languages]*

* Abyssal
* Celestial
* Draconic
* Infernal

#### Equipment
* A set of fine clothes
* A pouch containing 5gp

#### Feature: Court Functionary
Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.

#### Characteristics
*[The option(s) I am erring towards]*
##### Personality Trait
I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.
##### Ideal
* Freedom - Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)
* Aspiration - I work hard to be the best there is at my craft.

##### Bond
* I owe my organisation a great debt for forging me into the person I am today.
* One day I will return to my organisation and prove that I am the greatest courtier of them all.
* I will get revenge of the evil forces that destroyed/damaged my organisation and ruined my livelihood.

##### Flaw
* I'm never satisfied with what I have - I always want more.
* I would kill to acquire a noble title.
